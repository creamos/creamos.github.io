        { "type": "text", "value": "This project has been made on Unity, the multiplayer thingy relies on LAN and is based on Mirror, a Unity networking framework. I mainly worked on the programming and did a few vfx, shaders, and props. It was really interesting to work on a remote multiplayer game and learn how to synchronize multiple instances of a same scene. I also learned a lot about shaders as I tried different approches of rendering technics for the distant blackhole like raymarching shaders." }
